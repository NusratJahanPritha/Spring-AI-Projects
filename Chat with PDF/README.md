It is a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) app in Java that can let you query/chat with your PDFs using generative AI.

This project contains some more advanced topics, like how to run RAG apps locally (with OpenAI), how to update a vector DB with new items, how to use RAG with PDFs (or any other files), and how to test the quality of AI generated responses.
